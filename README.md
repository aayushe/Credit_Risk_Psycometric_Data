# Credit_Risk_Psycometric_Data
This project is an attempt to shift credit scoring system from traditional FICO score to Psycological Scoring system.

ML in psychological science is the field of Psychometric Credit Score. A Psychometric Credit Score is a predictive model based on a microcredit applicant psychological and behavioral profile which is a substitute of the FICO score used for banked applicants


ML could be a useful complement to inferential statistics and will help in achieving at least the following objectives:
– developing models which can generalize/replicate to fresh new data;
– developing models focused on prediction also at single subject level.
